        [X] HashRingDatastoreManager
        [X] MutableClusterView
            [X] Remove method getListenPorts() - unused and depends on ServicePorts from core-lib
            [X] Refactored out ServicePorts and Port dependency, moved iface and impl classes
    [X] Move replicated datastore impl to services/datastore/impl/replicated
    [X] EHCACHE implementation
        [X] Create maven module: services/datastore/impl/ehcache
        [X] Move code from core-lib to services/datastore/impl/ehcache
        [X] Remove dead code - EHCacheDatastoreMBean

[X] DEAD CODE
    [X] UnaddressableKeyException x2 (REMOVE)
    [X] ClusteredDatastore
    [X] AbstractMutableClusterView


[ ] TEST CLEANUP
    [X] components/datastore/src/test/java/com.rackspace.papi.components.datastore.integration
        - Removed as none were used as actual tests
    [ ] DistDatastoreServiceTest
        [X] bad sleep during cleanup.  Fix this.
        [ ] fix hardcoded datastore service endpoint
    [ ] RemoteCommandExecutorTest (all ignored)

[X] Analyze impact to DDFilter
    [X] Moving classes from filter package space to service package space (serialization issues???)

[X] Evaluate core-lib/datastore classes for initializing dist datastore.  How can we refactor this to move
    towards being able to easily change out implementations of a datastore.

[X] DatastoreService interface
    [X] move back to core-lib and factored out DatastoreService from unnecessary class usage
    [-] rename - confusing with "Datastore" and "DatastoreManager"
    [-] AvailabilityGuard - we removed getDatastore() and the throwing of a DatastoreUnavailabilityException.  Impact???
    [X] AvailabilityGuard - renamed to DatastoreManagerImpl
    [X] moved DatastoreService to Datastore service and renamed PowerApiDatastoreService to DatastoreServiceImpl and moved it to Datastore service

[X] DatastoreAccessControl - move from distributed impl to API

[X] DatastoreManager -
    [X] Review logic in deleted method: destroy().  Do we need to perform the cleanup logic that was coded there???
    [X] Review getName() and isDistributed() methods.  Not heavily used, but can likely be refactored.

[X] FINAL STEPS
    [X] Revert smoke test back to ApiValidatorRunSmokeTest from DistDatastoreFilter and DDService

[ ] DatastoreServiceContext - should we shut down all datastores.

[X] DistDatastoreServiceTest and DistDatastoreFilterTest - smoke test is failing

[X] Replicated Datastore Filter
    [X] REMOVE: Functional tests around Replicated Datastore Service
    [X] REMOVE: Deprecate the Replicated Datastore Filter
    [-] ReplicatedDatastoreFilterTest - Evaluate tests

TECHNICAL DEBT (out of scope)
=================================================================
[ ] NEW STORY: Cleanup package tangling between commons and services/httpclient.  Cleanup package tangling
    workarounds from aggregator pom.
[ ] NEW STORY: Evaluate usage of code - ReposeLocalCacheMBean, ReposeLocalCache

QUESTIONS FOR THE TEAM
=================================================================
[X] Should services be allowed to depend on core-lib ?
    ANSWER: No.  Let's try to keep services non-dependent on core-lib

[X] Who is responsible for initializing DatastoreManagers/Datastores?  Does this belong in the DatastoreServiceImpl?

[X] Where do the implementations of "Datastore" belong???
    TEAM: move components/datastores/api, components/datastores/ehcache, ...

[X] PRODUCT: remove ability to use ReplicatedDatastoreFilter with this next release.
    PRODUCT WEIGH-IN: YES!
    [X] If yes, remove the filter
    [X] If yes, remove DatastoreService.registerDatastoreManager(String datastoreManagerName, DatastoreManager manager);
    [X] Document removal in release notes
