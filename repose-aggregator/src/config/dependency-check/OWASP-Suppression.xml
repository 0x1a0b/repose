            NOTE: This is simply a case of mistaken identity.
            The echo-filter used for internal testing has the same name as a known vulnerable filter.

            The Java version of this library is not afflicted with this particular vulnerability.

            file name: jetty-6.1.26.jar
            NOTE: There is a transitive dependency with a known vulnerability exists, but it is not exposed.
            The Log4J Flume Appender is an event driven Flume Source that is supported by the Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) filter to send event data to a remote Flume Agent.
            The Log4J Flume Appender is not pollable even though it depends on the flume-ng-sdk which does support that type of source.
            Therefore the transitive dependency on an old Jetty version with a known vulnerability that is used to support polling does not expose the potential DOS attack vector in this instance.

            file name: jython-standalone-2.7.1.jar (shaded: com.google.guava:guava:22.0-android)
            NOTE: This is being fixed under issue https://bugs.jython.org/issue2728
            This is currently only potentially exposed if the Scripting filter is used with Python to deserialize certain data types.
