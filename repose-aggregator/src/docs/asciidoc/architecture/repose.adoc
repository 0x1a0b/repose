= Repose

== How Does Repose Work?
Repose takes incoming requests from clients and adjusts them for consumption by services by passing the requests through a series of extensible filters.
These filters provide functionality such as authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and request modification.
Repose can run as a stand-alone proxy server between the client and the origin service.
The Repose instance can be on the same host as the origin service, but it doesn't have to be.
This deployment method, illustrated in the following graphic, is called <<../recipes/valve-installation.adoc#,Valve>>.

Repose can also run within a servlet container such as GlassFish or Tomcat using the <<../recipes/war-installation.adoc#,WAR>> deployment.

You can decide which configuration works best for you, and you can tweak many of your configurations without having to restart Repose â€“ it will pick up configuration changes on the fly, making it easy to configure and test.

Repose can be configured to use a distributed data store service where cached information is exchanged across multiple nodes.
This makes Repose fault tolerant with proven performance.
