= Repose and Docker - Tips and Tricks

This is a collection of information cobbled together from several sources, but mostly from sifting through the https://docs.docker.com/[Official Docker Documentation] and then applying it to *Repose*.

The rest of this assumes you are already familiar with the contents of the <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc#,Quick Start>> and <<../recipes/docker.adoc#,Docker>> recipes.
Since you made it here your hunger for *Repose Docker* knowledge must not have been satiated, so read on and enjoy.

== Running Repose as a Docker Container
Basically you just need to:

. Acquire a Repose Docker image.
.. <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc#_repose_docker_images,Download a *Repose* Docker Image>>.
.. <<../recipes/docker.adoc#_manually_building_a_repose_docker_image,Build a *Repose* Docker Image>>
.. <<Build a Repose Docker Image with the build file>>
. <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc#_running_a_docker_container,Run the Repose Docker image in a Docker container>>

== Build a Repose Docker Image with the build file
The *Repose* build system expects your Docker Hub credentials to be available at build time.
They can be passed in as build properties or the easier way is to add them to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file:

- `dockerhub.username=<USERNAME>`
- `dockerhub.password=<PASSWORD>`

Then try to build a quick *Repose Docker* image from the root of the *Repose* project.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew \
    :repose-aggregator:artifacts:docker:buildUbuntuImageLocal \
    -Prepose-version={project-version}
----

This will ultimately result in a message similar to:

----
Successfully built IMAGE_ID
Created image with ID 'IMAGE_ID'.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

Since this method will not automatically tag the image, you will need to tag it yourself for easier reference later:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
docker tag IMAGE_ID local/repose:v{project-version}-ubuntu
----

== Logging inside the Repose Docker Container
The published images adhere to the expectations of https://12factor.net/logs[Twelve-Factor App logging] via streaming everything to `STDOUT`/`STDERR` and this is covered further in the <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc#_docker_container_logging,Quick Start>>.
Sometimes though, it may be handy to enable the regular *Repose Valve* logging that is disabled in the published images.

If you are using a published image, then you can execute an interactive session on a running container and uncomment the two `AppenderRef` lines below in the logging configuration file to begin logging to the standard `/var/log/repose/` location inside the container:

[source,xml]
./etc/repose/log4j2.xml (partial)
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration monitorInterval="15" packages="org.apache.logging.log4j.flume.appender">
      ...
            <AppenderRef ref="RollingFile"/>
      ...
            <AppenderRef ref="PhoneHomeMessages"/>
      ...
</Configuration>
----

If you are building your own image based on one of the *Repose Dockerfile*'s, then you can simply remove the lines below and the *Repose* image will log to the standard `/var/log/repose/` location.

----
RUN sed -i 's,<\(Appender.*RollingFile.*/\)>,<!--\1-->,' ${APP_ROOT}/log4j2.xml
RUN sed -i 's,<\(Appender.*PhoneHomeMessages.*/\)>,<!--\1-->,' ${APP_ROOT}/log4j2.xml
----

The `/var/log/repose/` logging directory has also been modified in the Dockerfile to allow logging to be turned on and also support arbitrary user ID's like are used in the OpenShift environment.

To access the *Repose* log files, you can mount the directory as a Docker volume when starting the container using a command like the following:

----
docker run                                   \
   --detach                                  \
   --volume /my/config/directory:/etc/repose \
   --volume /var/log/repose:/var/log/repose  \ <1>
   --publish 8080:8080                       \
   --env JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx1024m                 \
   --name my_repose                          \
   rackerlabs/repose:latest
----
<1> This option defines a volume that is mounted from the host (i.e., the OS running Docker) onto the Docker container.
    The volume mapping format is `HOST_DIRECTORY:CONTAINER_DIRECTORY`.
    So in this case, the contents of `/var/log/repose` in the container will be available on the host's `/var/log/repose` directory.
    This allows us to `tail` or persist the logs even if the Docker container is restarted.

If you didn't recognize it, this is almost the identical command provided in the <<../recipes/docker.adoc#_using_a_repose_docker_image,Docker recipe's Using a Repose Docker Image>> section, but with the extra volume mount option.
