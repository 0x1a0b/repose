= URI Redaction service

The URI Redaction service enables *Repose* to redact sensitive information contained in a URI.

This is extremely useful for removing user tokens from API calls prior to creating OpenTracing spans.
The URI Redaction service can be used by any service or filter, even custom ones, that need to redact any information from a URI during processing.

== Configuration
* *Default Configuration:* uri-redaction.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v8..?.?.?
* link:../schemas/uri-redaction.xsd[Schema]

=== Full Configuration
The configuration for this service is extremely simple.
It consists of a root element and a repeating list of a single element.
The values of the repeating `redact` elements are regular expressions (RegEx's) that need to adhere to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java Regular Expression] syntax.
Each of the RegEx's will be processed in order from top to bottom.
The first RegEx will be passed the original URI.
Then the result passed to the next RegEx and so on through the list.
Each capture group will be replaced with the literal `XXXXX`.
If multiple capture groups are present in a single RegEx, then all of them are redacted.

[NOTE]
====
Nested capture groups are not supported and should not be used.

<1> This RegEx would redact the third path segment of calls to the `v1` API that had four or more path segments. +
    Example: `/v1/two/three/four/five/` +
    Becomes: `/v1/two/XXXXX/four/five/`
<2> This RegEx would redact the third and fifth path segments of calls to the `v2` API that had exactly six path segments regardless of a trailing slash. +
    Example: `/v2/two/three/four/five/six` +
    Becomes: `/v2/two/XXXXX/four/XXXXX/six`

=== Using Entity Expansion
Sometimes it is easier to replace some or all of a RegEx with XML Entities that will be expanded during processing.
This can provide a more readable and therefore maintainable configuration.

=== Multiple Redactions on the same URI
Sometimes it is easier to replace some or all of a RegEx with XML Entities that will be expanded during processing.
This can provide a more readable and therefore maintainable configuration.
