= Metrics Service

The Metrics Service enables the registration, collection, and reporting of metrics across Repose.

Metrics collected by this service provide insight into the state of Repose and its components at any given time.

== Background

The goal of the Metrics Service is to provide a simple, convenient mechanism for gathering and reporting metrics.
To that end, the Metrics Service manages a centralized metrics registry and reporters for that registry.
By exposing the Metrics Service as a Java `@Named` component, other Repose components may easily leverage the ability to record metrics.

Implementation wise, the Metrics Service is a light-weight wrapper around the http://metrics.dropwizard.io/[Dropwizard metrics library].
This allows the service to offer all of the capabilities of a powerful, open-source metrics library.

== Configuration
* *Default Configuration:* metrics.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v2.7.0

=== Full Configuration
[source, xml]
.metrics.cfg.xml
----
<metrics xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/metrics/v1.0"
         enabled="true"> <!--1-->
    <graphite> <!--2-->
        <server host="graphite.example.com" <!--3-->

----
<1> Enables the service.
If this attribute is set to `false`, then metrics will not be reported, +
Defaults to `true`.
<2> Holds the Graphite server definitions.
<3> Declares that a Graphite server running on the `graphite.example.com` host should receive published metrics.
<4> Declares the port that the Graphite server is listening on.
<5> Defines the polling period, in seconds, of the Graphite reporter.
In this case, new metrics will be sent to the Graphite server every `10` seconds.
<6> Defines the prefix which will be prepended to the names of any metrics being sent to the Graphite server.

== Further Information
For more information about what the Metrics service can do, see the http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.2.0/manual/index.html[Dropwizard Metrics User Manual].

=== JMX Reporting

All metrics reported to this service will be reported to JMX.

In order to report metrics to JMX, this service must translate metric names into https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/management/ObjectName.html[JMX ObjectNames].
A metric can be named virtually anything, but names often follow the `<segment1>.<segment2>.<...>.<segmentn>` convention.
A simplified general form for an object name is `<domain>:<key1>=<value1>,<key2>=<value2>,<...>,<keyn>=<valuen>`.
To go from metric name to object name, the translation process will start by prepending the metric name with the hostname of the host running Repose.
Next, it will split the metric name using `.` as a delimiter.
The index of each delimited segment will act as the key for that segment, and the value of the segment will act as the value.

For example, a metric named `org.openrepose.example.count` will be reported to JMX as `<hostname>:001="org",002="openrepose",003="example",004="count"`.

While this approach can cause some difficulty in querying metrics from JMX, it provides easier navigation of metrics when using a tool such as http://openjdk.java.net/tools/svc/jconsole/[JConsole].

=== Aggregating Metrics

This service supports the automatic aggregation of certain metrics.
In some cases, aggregating metrics provides useful insight into the system at a level where individual metrics may not be present.
For example, a `Meter` on its own might track the status codes sent in responses from a single filter.
However, we want to be able to view the status codes send in responses from all filters.
For that purpose, this service supplies a `SummingMeter`.
See <<SummingMeter>> for more details.

The following nested sections provide details about the supported aggregation metrics.

==== Summing Meter

`MultiMeter` s can be used to mark multiple `Meter` s at the same time.
While this makes `MultiMeter` s generally useful, when used in conjunction with the `SummingMeterFactory`, they are used to track an additional `Meter` which serves as the sum of all `Meter` s created by the `SummingMeterFactory`.

A summing `Meter` should be constructed by utilizing the `SummingMeterFactory` accessible via this service.

[source, java]
----
SummingMeterFactory summingMeterFactory =
    metricsService.createSummingMeterFactory("prefix"); // <1> <2>

Meter meter =
    summingMeterFactory.createSummingMeter("summingMeter"); // <3>

meter.mark(); // <4>
----
<1> Assume that the `MetricsService` has been injected.
<2> Creates a `SummingMeterFactory` which will prefix the names of all `Meter` s it creates with `prefix`.
<3> Creates a `MultiMeter` registered with the name `prefix.summingMeter` which provides the same interactions as a standard `Meter`.
<4> Marks the `MultiMeter`.
    When marked, `MultiMeter` s created in this way will mark themselves as well as an `ACROSS ALL` meter with the same prefix (e.g., `prefix.ACROSS ALL`).

The `SummingMeterFactory` also provides support for `Meter` trees.
These trees enable nesting of `Meter` s in more interesting ways.

[source, java]
----
SummingMeterFactory parentSummingMeterFactory =
    metricsService.createSummingMeterFactory(MetricRegistry.name("prefix", "parent"));

SummingMeterFactory childSummingMeterFactory =
    parentSummingMeter.createChildFactory("child"); // <1>

Meter meter =
    childSummingMeterFactory.createSummingMeter("summingMeter"); // <2>

meter.mark(); // <3>
----
<1> Creates a `SummingMeterFactory` with a full prefix of `prefix.parent.child`.
<2> Creates a `Meter` with the name `prefix.parent.child.summingMeter`.
<3> Marks the `Meter` as well as both `ACROSS ALL` `Meter` s of the ancestral `SummingMeterFactory` s.
    This means that all of the following `Metric` s are marked: `prefix.parent.child.summingMeter`, `prefix.parent.child.ACROSS ALL`, and `prefix.parent.ACROSS ALL`.
