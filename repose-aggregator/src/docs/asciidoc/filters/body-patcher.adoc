= Body Patcher Filter

This filter allows changes to the request/response body based on a path regex and content type.

Changes take the form of JSON Patches as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[RFC 6902].

== General filter information
* *Name:* body-patcher
* *Default Configuration:* body-patcher.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v8.0.0.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/body-patcher.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
* `Content-Type`

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no hard dependency on any other filter.

However, the <<api-validator.adoc#, API Validator filter>> can be used to validate the request body before attempting to apply patches.

=== Request Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any request headers.

=== Request Body Changes
Changes to the request body vary based on configuration.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not a dependency of any other filter.

=== Response Body Changes
Changes to the response body vary based on configuration.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
[cols="2", options="header,autowidth"]
.Status Codes
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons

| `400`
a| * When the content type of the request is JSON, but the body cannot be parsed as such.

| `500`
a| * Any configured patch is not valid JSON.
a| * A configured patch cannot be applied to the request/response body.
a| * When the content type of the response is JSON, but the body cannot be parsed as such.
|===

== Examples
=== Exhaustive
This configuration will apply a set of patches to HTTP messages for various resources.
In doing so, it will demonstrate all of the functions of this filter.

----
<1> Declares a change to be made.
    The absence of the path attribute indicates that this change applies to requests with any path.
<2> Contains the set of patches to be applied to the request.
    This element is optional, but at least one of the `request` and `response` elements must be present.
<3> The action to take for JSON content.
    The content of this element should be a JSON patch.
    In this case, the JSON patch will replace the value of the `a` field with `6`, and remove the `b` field.
<4> Contains the set of patches to be applied to the response.
    This element is optional, but at least one of the `request` and `response` elements must be present.
<5> In this case, the JSON patch will add a `d` field with a value of `false`.
<6> Declares a change to be made, but only to requests with a path matching the regular expression `/foo/bar/.*`.
