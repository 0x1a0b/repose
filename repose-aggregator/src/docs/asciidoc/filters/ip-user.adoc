= IP User Filter

The IP User filter populates request headers using the client's IP address and matching configured group, if any.

== General filter information
* *Name:* ip-user
* *Default Configuration:* ip-user.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v7.2.2.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/ip-user.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
This filter does not require any request headers.

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependencies on other filters and can be placed wherever it is needed in the filter chain.
However, due to the nature of this filter it is typically placed early in the filter chain.

=== Request Headers Created
* `X-PP-User` - Will be set to the source IP of the request.
* `X-PP-Groups` - Will be set to the name the first group with a matching Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address.
** IF there is not a match, THEN this header will not be added.

[NOTE]
====
The name of these headers can be changed from these default values in the configuration.
====

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.
However, the following filters may be useful:

* <<simple-rbac.adoc#, Simple RBAC filter>> - Provides role-based access control to the origin service's API, which can be configured to directly use the `X-PP-Groups`.
* <<api-validator.adoc#, API Validator filter>> - Provides role-based access control to the origin service's API, making use of the `X-PP-Groups` header.
* <<rate-limiting.adoc#, Rate Limiting filter>> - Provides rate limiting, making use of the `X-PP-User` header.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
This filter does not modify the response code.

== Examples
=== Basic Configuration
This configuration will provide the default headers using the client's IP Address.

=== Optional Configuration
This configuration shows explicitly naming the user and group headers to their default values and setting their qualities to the default also.

[NOTE]

IF present, THEN the `group-header` must be the element directly before the first `group` element.

There must be at least one `group` element definition.
