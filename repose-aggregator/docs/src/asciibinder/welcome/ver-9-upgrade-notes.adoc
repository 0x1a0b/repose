= Upgrade to Version 9 from Version 8 Notes

== Container Configuration
. The `via` attribute was removed from the <<../architecture/container.adoc#, container configuration>>.
  It has been replaced with the `via-header` element.
  To replicate the previous behavior set the value that was previously in the `via` attribute in the `request-prefix` and `response-prefix` attributes of the new element.

== WAR Deployment
. Support for installing *Repose* into an existing container has been dropped. For help moving to another deployment see <<../recipes/valve-installation.adoc, Valve Installation>> and <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc, Quick Start with Docker>>.

== HTTP Client/Connection Pool Service
. If setting the `chunked-encoding` attribute, it will no longer be set in <<../services/http-client.adoc#configuration, HTTP Client Service configuration>> but instead will be set in the <<architecture/system-model.adoc#configuration, System Model configuration>>.
.. Deprecated configuration values have been removed; change `0` to `false` and `1` to `true`.

== Rackspace Auth User, SAML Policy Translation, and Attribute Mapping Policy Validation Filters
. Consult with identity for where these filters now live.

== Header Normalization Filter
. All matching targets will now be processed, previously only the first target that matched would be evaluated.

== URL Extractor to Header Filter
. All capture groups in the URL regex will now add their captured values to the desired header.
.. If you have configured a URL regex with multiple capture groups but do not desire the values of some of those groups to be added to the header, use the non-capturing group construct (i.e., `(?:X)`).
   See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#special[the special constructs portion of the Java Pattern documentation] for more information.
