= Upgrade to Version 9 from Version 8 Notes

== Container Configuration
. The `via` attribute was removed from the <<../architecture/container.adoc#, container configuration>>.
  It has been replaced with the `via-header` element.
  To replicate the previous behavior set the value that was previously in the `via` attribute in the `request-prefix` and `response-prefix` attributes of the new element.

== HTTP Client/Connection Pool Service
. If setting the `chunked-encoding` attribute, change `0` to `false` and `1` to `true`.

== Rackspace Auth User, SAML Policy Translation, and Attribute Mapping Policy Validation Filters
. Consult with identity for where these filters now live.

== Header Normalization Filter
. All matching targets will now be processed, previously only the first target that matched would be evaluated.
