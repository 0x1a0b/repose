= Split Header Filter

The Split Header Filter splits header lines with multiple values into multiple header lines each with a single value.

Header values are split using the comma character (,) as a delimiter.

This filter can process both requests and responses.

[WARNING]
====
This filter does not distinguish between headers that should and should not be split.
Any header configured to be split will be split.
Care should to taken to ensure that headers that should not be split (e.g., `User-Agent`) are not configured to be split.
Please refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5[RFC7231] for details on standard HTTP headers and their syntax.

== General filter information
* *Name:* split-header
* *Default Configuration:* split-header.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v8.9.1.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/split-header.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
This filter does not require any request headers.

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependency on any other filter.

=== Request Headers Created
Changes to request headers vary based on configuration.

Existing request headers may be split across multiple lines.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter has no recommended follow-on filters.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
Changes to response headers vary based on configuration.

Existing response headers may be split across multiple lines.

=== Response Status Codes
This filter does not modify the response code.

== Examples
=== Exhaustive
This configuration will split the `Accept` and `X-Roles` headers on the request, and the `Cache-Control` header on the response.

For example, if a request is made with the header lines:
```
Accept: application/json, application/xml
Accept: text/plain
```

This filter will split those header lines into the header lines:
```
Accept: application/json
Accept: application/xml
Accept: text/plain
```

----
<1> A container for all of the request headers that should be split by this filter.
<2> A header to be split by this filter.
    In this case, the standard HTTP `Accept` header will be split on requests.
<3> A header to be split by this filter.
    In this case, the *Repose*-specific `X-Roles` header will be split on requests.
<4> A container for all of the response headers that should be split by this filter.
<5> A header to be split by this filter.
    In this case, the standard HTTP `Cache-Control` header will be split on responses.

== Additional Information
== Legacy
This filter may be used to imitate the the behavior of *Repose* when header splitting was performed as a core function rather than by this filter (prior to *Repose* v9).
To configure this filter for that use case, see the <<../recipes/header-splitting.adoc#_add_the_split_header_filter_config, *Repose* < 9.0 Header Splitting Behavior recipe>>.
