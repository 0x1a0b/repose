= Jenkins Customization for RSI:Apps (OpenShift Origin)

The purpose of this branch is to contain Jenkins configuration for an internal instance of Jenkins running in RSI:Apps (OpenShift Origin).
The usage of these files is detailed by the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins#installing-using-s2i-build[source-to-image (S2I) build process for the OpenShift Jenkins image].

By maintaining this branch, we keep a versioned history of the configuration of our internal Jenkins instance.
Doing so makes recovering Jenkins trivial in case of failure.
However, since some state (e.g., job history) is stored in a persistent volume in OpenShift, it will be lost if OpenShift fails rather than Jenkins.

For more information, see the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html[OpenShift Jenkins image documentation].
Specifically, the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html#jenkins-as-s2i-builder[Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder section].

== Setup

. Create a project in RSI.
. Add the link:repose-jenkins.is.yaml[placeholder ImageStream definition] to the project.
. Add the link:repose-jenkins.bc.yaml[source-to-image (S2I) build definition] to the project.
. Start an image build.
. Deploy Jenkins using the `Jenkins (Persistent)` template.
.. Replace the `Jenkins ImageStream Namespace` parameter with the name of the project (e.g., `jenkins`).
.. Replace the `Jenkins ImageStreamTag` parameter with `repose-jenkins:latest`.

Congratulations!
Jenkins should now be running in OpenShift with customizations applied!

== Notes

[NOTE]
====
We manage plugins as binaries in the `plugins/` directory rather than including them in the `plugins.txt` file.
The reason is that when downloading a plugin from the Jenkins plugin repository, the repository may redirect to an insecure mirror (i.e., HTTP (80) instead of HTTPS (443)) which gets blocked by RSI:Apps.

[NOTE]
====
When setting up Jenkins, it may be necessary to reconfigure the Checkmarx user credentials.
This can be done by simply plugging the credentials into the global Checkmarx plugin configuration in Jenkins.
