Power API is an open-source platform that you can use to build stacks of reusable software
components. These components can be leveraged by service developers to perform
common API processing tasks. By using Power API's components rather than creating their
own, service developers can focus on the unique features of their services.

Power API can be used inside a service to perform API operations. It can also run on one or
more separate servers as a proxy to one or more services. At its core, Power API is a proxy
that allows services to use Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP).
